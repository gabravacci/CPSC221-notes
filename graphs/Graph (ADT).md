We define $n$ as the number of vertices and let $m$ be the number of edges in a [[Graphs|graph (math)]]. Mathematically: $|V| = n,\, |E| = m$. 

## Edge-vertices relationships
### Lower bounds
For a *connected* graph we have a minimum $n-1$ edges. Naturally, if itâ€™s not connected we can have *no* edges. 

A graph is *minimally* connected if it has exactly $n-1$ edges.
### Upper bounds
For upper bounds we require knowledge on graph *simplicity*. If a graph is simple the maximum number of edges is $n(n-1)/2$. If the graph is *not* simple we have no upper bound on number of edges. A graph then is *complete* if it has exactly $n(n-1)/2$ edges.

Thus we can notice that for practicality we need our implementations to be simple and connected graphs. 
## Implementations
### Adjacency Matrix
The **adjacency matrix** implementation gives the following time complexities for the functions:
- `insertVertex(V v)`: $O(1)$ (best) $\Theta(n^2)$ (worst) or $O(n)$ (amortized)
- `removeVertex(V v)`: Similar as above (because of resizing) with best case $O(n)$
- `areAdjacent(V v, V u)`: $O(1)$
- `incidentEdges(V v)`: $O(n)$

### Adjacency list
With an **adjacency list** representation we have $\Theta(n+m)$ space usage, and the functions become:
- `insertVertex(V v)`: $O(1)$ (best) $\Theta(n^2)$ (worst) or $O(n)$ (amortized)
- `removeVertex(V v)`: Similar as above (because of resizing) with best case $O(n)$
- `areAdjacent(V v, V u)`: $O(1)$
- `incidentEdges(V v)`: $O(n)$

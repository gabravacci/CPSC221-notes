A [[Graphs|graph]] is *connected* if there is a path between any two vertices. If the graph is directed, it is *strongly connected* if there is a *directed* path from any vertex to any other. It is *weakly connected* if the path between two vertices doesn’t follow a specific direction. The graph is complete if there’s an edge between every pair. A graph is *minimally connected* if the removal from any edge makes it so the graph is no longer connected.

## Minimal connection theorem
A minimal connected graph $G = (V,E)$ has $|V| - 1$ edges.
